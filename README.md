A sample repo demonstrating browser testing using Clojure. For full
write up and usage, see the accompanying recipe,
["Running Browser-based Tests"](https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/clojure-cookbook/blob/master/testing/browser-testing/browser-testing.asciidoc#running-browser-based-tests),
a part of the [Clojure Cookbook](http://clojure-cookbook.com/).

## Caveats

This sample requires **Leiningen version 2.3+**. If you do not have a
compatible version, tests will not run correctly.

Please ensure you have a compatible version of Leiningen before
reporting any issues.
